# FALCON Requirements
# Flexible Authentication Login Cracking & Optimized Node

# Python Version
# Requires Python 3.7 or higher

## System Dependencies

### Required
- hashcat (password cracking engine)
  Installation on Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```
  sudo apt install hashcat
  ```

### Optional: GPU Support

#### For NVIDIA GPUs
```
sudo apt install nvidia-utils nvidia-driver-XXX
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
```

#### For AMD GPUs
```
sudo apt install rocm-hip
```

#### For Intel GPUs
```
sudo apt install intel-compute-runtime
```

## Python Standard Library (No external pip packages required!)

FALCON uses only Python built-in modules:
- subprocess (for executing hashcat commands)
- os (for system operations)
- sys (for system-specific parameters)
- pathlib (for file path handling)
- typing (for type hints)
- shutil (for file and command utilities)
- time (for animation timing)

All modules are built-in with Python 3.7+, no additional installation needed!

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Hashcat
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install hashcat
```

Verify installation:
```bash
hashcat --version
```

### 2. (Optional) Install GPU Drivers
For GPU acceleration, install the appropriate drivers for your hardware.

### 3. Download FALCON
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chrxstxqn/FALCON
cd FALCON
```

### 4. Make FALCON Executable
```bash
chmod +x falcon.py
```

### 5. Run FALCON
```bash
python3 falcon.py
# or
./falcon.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hashcat not found
If you get "Hashcat not found in PATH":
```bash
which hashcat
# If empty, hashcat is not installed. Run:
sudo apt install hashcat
```

### GPU Not Detected
If hashcat doesn't detect your GPU:
1. Verify GPU drivers are installed: `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA) or `rocm-smi` (AMD)
2. Check FALCON GPU setting in the configuration menu (option 7)
3. Ensure you have the latest GPU drivers

### Permission Denied
If you get permission errors:
```bash
sudo chmod +x falcon.py
sudo python3 falcon.py
```

Or use without sudo by adjusting file permissions:
```bash
chmod +x falcon.py
./falcon.py
```

## Minimum System Requirements

- CPU: Dual-core processor or better
- RAM: 2GB minimum (4GB+ recommended)
- Storage: 1GB for wordlists and dictionaries
- GPU: Optional but recommended for better performance

## Supported Operating Systems

- Debian 10+
- Ubuntu 18.04+
- Linux Mint
- Elementary OS
- Any Debian-based distribution

## Notes

- FALCON is a wrapper around hashcat, not a replacement
- Always ensure you have permission to crack hashes you are testing
- GPU acceleration significantly improves performance for certain hash types
- The workload setting affects speed and system resource usage (1=low, 4=nightmare)
